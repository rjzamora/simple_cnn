# Simple CNN Code (Forked from: https://github.com/can1357/simple_cnn)

This README file is written by Rick Zamora (rzamora@anl.gov).

Original README file is in `README-original.md`

## To Run `train_shallow.cpp` Example:

```
cd ~/simple_cnn
make
make run
```

## Other Information

The `~/simple_cnn/mnist_example/train_shallow.cpp` example performs training and inference on a single image at a time. Only one `*.cpp` file needs to be compiled (see Makefile), because this file simply uses the header files in `~/simple_cnn/CNN/`
